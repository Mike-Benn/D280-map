## D280 Angular Project 

Project for D280 where we are to take an SVG map of the world and add functionality to it where whenever the user hovers over a country it is highlighted and a pane of information pops up
with some statistics of that country.  We were to fetch the country data from the World Bank API using observables in Angular.
